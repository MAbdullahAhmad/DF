## Standards

- We'll divide our code into some major parts.
- the major parts will exist in 'includes' directory
- remember that the 'class' storing files must be capitalized for exapmle 'OutputManager' instead of 'output_manager' (also known as camal-case)
- the libraries that will store helpful functions and does not have any 'main' class they will be un underscored small letters. 'my_helpers' example.
